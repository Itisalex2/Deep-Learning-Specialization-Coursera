# Deep Learning Specialization - Coursera

This repository contains my notes, assignments, and certificates from the [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning?utm_medium=sem&utm_source=gg&utm_campaign=B2C_NAMER_deep-learning_deeplearning-ai_FTCOF_specializations_country-US-country-CA&campaignid=904733485&adgroupid=148411448815&device=c&keyword=&matchtype=&network=g&devicemodel=&adposition=&creativeid=654837734383&hide_mobile_promo&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjw6oi4BhD1ARIsAL6pox1Y0CO-KqQM5he04ezVNSSb6vG8uo8g_ygIcY-VOtOJf7aAi2MdUeYaAs2cEALw_wcB) offered by DeepLearning.AI on Coursera.

## About the Specialization

The Deep Learning Specialization provides a comprehensive introduction to deep learning, one of the most transformative technologies in AI. The courses are taught by Andrew Ng and cover both the theory and practical aspects of deep learning. Throughout the specialization, I gained expertise in:

- Neural Networks
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
- Deep Learning frameworks (TensorFlow)
- Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization, and Optimization

## Course Structure

The specialization consists of 5 courses:

1. **Neural Networks and Deep Learning**
   - Introduction to deep learning and neural networks.
   - Key topics: forward and backward propagation, activation functions, loss functions.

2. **Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization, and Optimization**
   - Advanced techniques to improve the performance of deep networks.
   - Key topics: regularization, gradient checking, learning rate scheduling.

3. **Structuring Machine Learning Projects**
   - Best practices for structuring and managing machine learning projects.
   - Key topics: error analysis, orthogonalization, and ML project lifecycle.

4. **Convolutional Neural Networks**
   - Deep dive into CNNs and their applications.
   - Key topics: object detection, transfer learning, data augmentation.

5. **Sequence Models**
   - Study of sequence models for tasks involving sequential data.
   - Key topics: recurrent neural networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), attention mechanisms.
